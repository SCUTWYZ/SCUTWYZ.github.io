I am an undergraduate student at the faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT). I'm expected to graduate in 2024.


Research Interest and Strength
======
I'm interested in the interdisciplinary fields like social computing and urban computing. Specifically, I focus on the following issues:
1. The foundation models in these application fields, like graph model and spatio-temporal model.
2. The modeling, mining and optimization methods in large-scale data scenario, like social network opinion analysis, urban transporation system management.
3. The combinations with current hot topics, like LLM and knowledge graph.

<font color='red'> Now I'm looking for a PhD (or MPhil) chance. If you are interested in my experience, please feel free to contact me!!! </font>

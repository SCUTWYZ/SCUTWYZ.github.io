I am an undergraduate student at the faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT). I'm expected to graduate in 2024.


Research Interest and Strength
======
I'm interested in the interdisciplinary fields like social computing and urban computing. Specifically, I focus on the following issues:
1. The emergence and evolution of swarm phenomenon, like social network opinions. Meanwhile, I focus on social media multimodal (like text, graph) mining, network dynamics modeling and intelligent optimization;
2. Intelligent transportation, especially spatial-temporal prediction of road network traffic flow, the management and optimization of transportation system;
3. The application of LLM, knowledge graph and other advanced AI technology in above fields;
4. Other interesting issues in social computing and urban computing.

<font color='red'> Now I'm looking for a chance to pursue PhD (or MPhil). If you are interested in my experience, please feel free to contact me!!! </font>
